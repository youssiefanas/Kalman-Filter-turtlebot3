# Kalman-Filter-turtlebot3
Kalman Filter Esimation of TurtleBot3 Rotation. Sensor fusion technique will be developed for indoor localization of Turtlebot 3 mobile robot. The proposed sensor fusion method combines the measurements made by odometry of the robot and the acceleration measured by an onboard IMU to get the true state of the robot.
